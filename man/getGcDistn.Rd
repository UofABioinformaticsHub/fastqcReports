\description{
Generate a GC Content Distribution From Sequences
}
\details{
The function takes the supplied object and returns the theoretical GC
content distribution. Using a fixed read length essentially leads to a
discrete distribution so the bins argument is used to define the number of
bins returned. This defaults to 101 for 0 to 100% inclusive.

The returned values are obtained by interpolating the values obtained during
sampling. This avoids returned distributions with gaps and jumps as would be
obtained setting readLengths at values not in multiples of 100.
